# üí¨ About me

I am currently persuing my Master's degree with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, and the School of Design and Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. My major is Earth-oriented Space Science and Technology. I received my Bachelor's degree in engineering with the School of Remote Sensing and Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China in 2022.

My research interests include:
- Multi-source fusion positioning
- Ubiquitous navigation
- Remote sensing image interpretation
- Machine learning
